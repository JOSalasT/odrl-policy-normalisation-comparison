# Policy Comparison and Normalisation

This code allows for the normalisation of ODRL policies containing Permissions and Prohibitions in order to check for policy containment, equivalence or overlap.
The data structures for ODRL policies come from the [UPCAST Policy Engine](https://github.com/EU-UPCAST/PolicyEngine.git)

## Features

- Normalisation of ODRL constraints and refinements. Unique normal forms can only be guaranteed for policies with only permissions and prohibitions.
- Compares ODRL policies for containment, equivalence and overlap.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
