# Policy Comparison and Normalisation

This code allows for the normalisation of ODRL policies containing Permissions and Prohibitions in order to check for policy containment, equivalence or overlap.

## Features

- Normalisation of ODRL constraints and refinements. Unique normal forms can only be guaranteed for policies with only permissions and prohibitions.
- Compares ODRL policies for containment, equivalence and overlap.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- RDFLib 7.0.0

## Limitations

This implementation is a work in progress, and the following main limitations should be noted:

- Set operators in constraints and refinements, and the ODRL consequence, remedies and permission-duties rules are not supported.
- The support for ODRL targets and assignees is limited, and at the moment partial overlaps of these features migth not be correctly detected.

## Usage

A ContractParser element can be used to parse an ODRL policy in some RDF standard format and get an RDFLib graph.

```
parser = ContractParser()
parser.load(filename)
graph = parser.contract_graph
```

A map from left operands to sets of right operands can be extracted from a ContractParser using:
`values_per_constraints = parser.get_values_from_constraints()`

A GraphParser element can be used to parse an RDFLib graph to a Policy element.

```
graph_parser = GraphParser(graph)
policy = graph_parser.parse()
```

A Policy element can be normalised by using:
`normal_policy = policy.normalise()`

To split the intervals of a normalised policy:

`normal_split_policy = normal_policy.split_intervals(values_per_constraints)`

A PolicyComparer element can be used to compute the overlap or difference between sets of rules.

demo.py exposes a simple command line interface that allows users to:
- normalise a policy by reformulating logical constraints and simple constraints.
- normalise, split intervals according to the constants in other policies, and remove prohibitions that match permissions.
- compare two ODRL policies by computing their overlap and containment in both directions.

```
usage: command file1 [file2...]
command is one of 'normalise', 'normalise_prohibitions', 'compare'
'normalise' requires exactly one argument. This will normalise simple and logical constraints, but will not split intervals or remove prohibitions. 
'normalise_prohibitions' requires at least one file. This will normalise, split intervals and remove prohibitions that match permissions.
'compare' requires exactly 2 arguments. This will compute the overlap between the two policies and two-way containment.
```

## Example

test.py runs a couple of examples.
This is an ODRL policy that declares a permission with a logical constraint (as seen in examples/example_logical_constraint.json): 
```
{
  "odrl:permission": [
    {
      "odrl:action": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/appendTo",
      "odrl:assignee": "https://w3id.org/dpv/dpv-owl#Citizen",
      "odrl:target": ["http://example.org/datasets/climateChangeData", "http://example.org/datasets/climateChangeData2"],
      "odrl:constraint": [
        {
          "odrl:leftOperand": "purpose",
          "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/eq",
          "odrl:rightOperand": "https://w3id.org/dpv/dpv-owl#Personalisation"
        },
        {
          "odrl:and": [
            {
              "odrl:or": [
                {
                  "odrl:leftOperand": "A",
                  "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/lteq",
                  "odrl:rightOperand": 1
                },
                {
                  "odrl:leftOperand": "B",
                  "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/lteq",
                  "odrl:rightOperand": 3
                },
                {
                  "odrl:leftOperand": "C",
                  "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/lteq",
                  "odrl:rightOperand": 6
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "odrl:or": [
                {
                  "odrl:leftOperand": "D",
                  "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/lteq",
                  "odrl:rightOperand": 10
                },
                {
                  "odrl:leftOperand": "E",
                  "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/lteq",
                  "odrl:rightOperand": 8
                },
                {
                  "odrl:leftOperand": "F",
                  "odrl:operator": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/lteq",
                  "odrl:rightOperand": 4
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "@id": "http://example.org/policy-79f7e6ba-daff-4919-940f-a1ad1344a97a",
  "@context": {
        "rdf": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#",

```
By running the following:
```
contract_parser = ContractParser()
contract_parser.load("examples/example_logical_constraint.json")
graph_parser = GraphParser(contract_parser.contract_graph)
policy = graph_parser.parse()
policy = policy.normalise()
```
We get a normalised policy comprised of 36 minimal permissions that contains no logical constraints.
The same result can be achieved through the command line by running:
`python demo.py normalise examples/example_logical_constraint.json`


The next example compares "simple_permissions.ttl" against "examples/simple_permissions+prohibition_2.ttl" by running the following:
```
comparer = PolicyComparer.compare("examples/simple_permissions.ttl", "examples/simple_permissions+prohibitions_2.ttl")
print(f"Number of overlapping permissions: {len(comparer[0])}")
print(f"Is (1) contained in (2)? {comparer[1]}")
print(f"Is (2) contained in (1)? {comparer[2]}")
print(f"Are (1) and (2) equivalent? {comparer[1] and comparer[2]}")
```
And outputs the following:
```
Number of overlapping permissions: 1042
Is (1) contained in (2)? False
Is (2) contained in (1)? True
Are (1) and (2) equivalent? False
```
The same result can be achieved through the command line by running: `python demo.py compare examples/simple_permissions.ttl examples/simple_permissions+prohibitions_2.ttl`.

The next example shows two policies A (examples/simple_permissionsA.ttl) and B (examples/simple_permissionsB.ttl) that allow to "watermark https://w3id.org/dpv/owl#UnverifiedData"
provided the absolute spacial position is:
- A  P[70,90] (between 70 and 90)
- B  P[70,80] + P[80,90] (between 70 and 80 or between 80 and 90)

Although the intervals in B are split into two, it is evident that they allow the same actions. Therefore, the output is:

```
Number of overlapping permissions: 6
Is (1) contained in (2)? True
Is (2) contained in (1)? True
Are (1) and (2) equivalent? True
```

Finally, an example with two policies Ap (examples/simple_permissionsAp.ttl) and Bp (examples/simple_permissionsBp.ttl) with permissions that allow to "watermark https://w3id.org/dpv/owl#UnverifiedData"
provided the absolute spacial position is:

- For Ap P[60,90] (between 60 and 90) - F(70,80] (between 70 and 80, not including 70)
- For Bp  P[60,70] (between 60 and 70) + P(80,90] (between 80 and 90, not including 80)

Although these are different policies, it is evident that they restrict the same values. Therefore, the output is:

```
Number of overlapping permissions: 5
Is (1) contained in (2)? True
Is (2) contained in (1)? True
Are (1) and (2) equivalent? True
```
